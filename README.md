## Description

In this project we will focus on making a daily planner for the days that seem super busy. This daily planner is equipt with a feature that changes the time slots based on whether the time slot is is in the past, future, or at the current hour. This ui is helpful for our users to get an idea of where they are in terms of time of the day and tasks left to do. 

-In this project we learned the implementation of local storage for data storage and retrieval and bootstrap of various ui styling.
